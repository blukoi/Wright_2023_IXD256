## Assignment 1

The prompt for this assignment was to create a "button" or complete a circuit in a way which did not resemble a typical "push button" that you might find on an appliance.

I didn't necessarily have a purpose in mind, but I wanted to complete a circuit using coins.

[This is the original sketch I drew to prep for making the actual circuit using some copper tape and wiring.](/../main/Week03/Week02_Concept.jpg)

While making the circuit I decided to change the idea to have a red LED to show when the circuit is incomplete and a second, green, LED to show when the circuit is complete.

Final, physical prototype:
- [The circuitry from the Atom Matrix to the breadboard.](/../main/Week03/IMG_1936.JPG)
- [The completed prototype with the red LED on.](/../main/Week03/IMG_1937.JPG)
- [The completed prototype with 4 quarters completing the circuit.](/../main/Week03/IMG_1938.JPG)
- Click through for [a short video clip](https://github.com/blukoi/Wright_2023_IXD256/blob/main/Week03/IMG_1939.mov) showing the physical model working.
- [A schematic for the final circuit.](/../main/Week03/QuarterCircuit_schem.jpg)
